  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
    <p>ou are now taking part in an economic study. You will be matched with other players to play 10 rounds 
    of a simple voting game. In each round, one member of your group will be randomly selected to be the manager, 
    and the remainder will be voters.</p>
    
    <p>Your group is voting to pick a project. The better the project picked, the more points the group gets. 
      A bad project has no benefits for the group and pays no points. The decisions of the voters help determine 
      the quality of the project, by their choice among the following options:</p>

    <li>Vote Informed, which makes the group pick a better project.</li>
    <li>Vote Uninformed, which makes the group pick a worse project.</li>
    <li>Abstain from voting, which has no effect on the quality of the project picked.</li>
    
    The best project is picked if everyone in the group votes informed. And if everyone abstains or votes uninformed 
    then a bad project is picked and the group gets 0 points for that round.
    
    Note that the benefits of the project are shared equally with the whole group regardless of how they voted.
    We will say a bit more about the details of those benefits but first, let's discuss the manager. The manager's choice is simple:

    <li>Impose a cost on any voter who chooses to abstain</li>
    <li>Do not impose a cost on voters who choose to abstain</li>

    This choice does not directly affect the overall payoffs of the group, but may change behavior in beneficial or harmful ways. For instance, 
    if the decision makes more voters choose uninformed then the payoffs will be lower. The manager pays no direct cost for either decision and benefits solely based on their proportional share of the group payout. After each round the project is chosen based on the decisions of the group, and payoffs are tallied and distributed.
